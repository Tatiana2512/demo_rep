so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trust in who we are
and nothing else matters

never open myself this way
life is ours we live it our way
all these words i don't just say
and nothing else matters

trust i seek and i find in you
everyday for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters

never care for what they do
never care for what they know
