should've stayed were the signs i ignored?
can i help you not to hurt anymore?
we saw brilliants when the world was asleep
there are things that we can have but can't keep

if they say
who cares if one more light goes out 
in the sky of a millions stars?
it flickers, flickers
who cares if someone's time runs out
if a moment is all we are
we're quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do

the reminders pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen one more chair than you need (oh)
and you're angry and you should be it's not fair
just 'cause you cant'see it doesn't mean it isn't there
if they say

who cares if one more light goes out 
in the sky of a millions stars?
it flickers, flickers
who cares if someone's time runs out
if a moment is all we are
we're quicker, quicker
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do
